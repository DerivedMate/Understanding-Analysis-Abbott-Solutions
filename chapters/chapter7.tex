\chapter{The Riemann Integral}

\def\currChapter{7}
I'm not sure why, but there a quite of lot typos in this chapter.
I did not point out all of the typos, only the ones I felt like 
could potentially interfere with understanding the content.

Some of the problems also don't give you all the assumptions you need to
solve them, which is pretty frustrating if you've spent a good amount of time
trying to figure out a problem that is much harder than it needs to be.
