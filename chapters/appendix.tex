Collection of useful 

\begin{tip}
  Template for a proof that $(x_n) \rightarrow x$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary 
    \item Demonstrate a choice for $N \in \mathbb{N}$. 
    This step usually requires the most work, almost all of
    which is done prior to actually writing the formal proof.
    \item Now, show that $N$ works.
    \item Assume $n \geq N$
    \item With $N$ well chosen,  you should be able to show $\abs{x_n - x} < \epsilon$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{tip}

\begin{itemize}
  \item In Chapter 2, we learn that addition in infinite sums is not commutative.
