# Understanding Analysis Solutions

These are unofficial solutions for _Understanding Analysis_ by Abbott.
I started these solutions since I was self-studying real analysis,
and felt that I might as well give the problems an effort by writing
out solutions.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork and submit a PR!

## TODOs

I use `\TODO` to mark the problems that need work or don't have solutions.
There are also `TODO` comments if there are more minor parts that need work, e.g. spacing or prettier formatting.

## Work to be done

1. Consistent formatting
2. Check work!
3. Incomplete problems
