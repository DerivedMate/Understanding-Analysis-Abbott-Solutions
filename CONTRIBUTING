Try to make your solutions as explanatory as possible. Since Abbott wrote this
textbook to be very easy to read, it would also be nice for the solutions to be
an easy read as well.

Some guidelines:
 
 - Try to use good LaTeX coding practices
 - Use `definitions`, `lemmas`, `theorems` where appropriate
 - If you need to label equations, try to use names that will not likely be used again
